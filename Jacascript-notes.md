## Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages.

- Used to **make websites interactive**.

- Offers many career opportunities.

- JS = JavaScript (not Java).

- Super fun and widely supported!

---

## Your Tools

You’ll be using:

- Chrome (or Chromium-based browser)

- CodePen (web-based editor – great for sharing and experimenting)

- Instructor-provided links for live coding and demos

---

## Assignment Overview

Assignment 1: JavaScript

- Released after the first session via the #announcements channel on Slack.

- 2 questions:

 - 1 creative coding question

 - 1 research question (with 3 sub-topics)

- Worth 44 marks total

- Focused on:

 - Code quality

 - Creativity

 - Use of JavaScript concepts (from all 6 lessons)

 - Practical and readable code

## Strings and Output

`console.log`
- Used to print output to the console.

- Strings are placed in double quotes "like this".

**Example**
```js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

**Debugging**
- Mistakes happen! Use the console to check for syntax errors and typos

---

## Comments

- Comments are ignored by the browser - they're for humans reading the code:

**Example:**
```js
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/

---

## Contstants

- A constant **stores a value that doesn't change**.

- Use `const` to declare it.

**Example**
```js
const greeting = "Hello there!"; /* Creates the greeting */
console.log(greeting); /* Show the 'greeting' in the console */
```
- You can only assign a value to a constant once.

---

## Concatenation

- Concatenation = joining strings together with `+`

**Example**
```js
const name = "Alex"; /* Create the const variable */
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!"); /* Log the greeting and name to the console */
```

---

## Interploation *(Template Literals)*

- Easier and cleaner way to **insert values into strings**.

- Uses **template literals**: backticks `, ${} for variables.

- Uses `backticks instead of quotes
- Uses `${variable}` to insert values

```js
const name = "Alex";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

---

## Data Types

- String: "text"

- Number: 42, 3.14

- Boolean: `true`, `false`

- Operators behave differently with different types!

## User Input with `prompt()
`prompt()` pops up a box to get input from the user:

**Example:**
```js
const name = prompt("What's your name?");
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

**Maths Operators**:

| Operator | Name               | Example  | Result |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition           | `2 + 3`  | `5`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `10 - 4` | `6`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `5 * 2`  | `10`   |
| `/`      | Division           | `10 / 2` | `5`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation     | `2 ** 3` | `8`    |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `7 % 3`  | `1`    |

## Casting Data Types

- Casting = **changing a value's type.**

**Example:**

```js
const input = prompt(Enter a number);
const result = Number(input) + 1;
console.log(result);
```

- `Number(value)` converts to a number
- `String(value)` converts to a string
