# Function Revision Tasks

‚úÖ 1. Fill in the blanks
You wrote:

‚úÖ A parameter is a placeholder for a value
‚úÖ An argument is the value
‚ö†Ô∏è The return keyword is used to store a value
‚úÖ The console.log() function is used to log

     CORRECTION
     ‚úÖ The return keyword is used to send a value back from the function.
        You can then store that returned value in a variable, but return itself doesn't store it.

‚úÖ 2. Code Reading
```js
Copy
Edit
function getGreeting(name) {
  return `Hi, ${name}!`;
}

let greeting = getGreeting("Sam");
console.log(greeting);
```
‚úîÔ∏è You said: "Hi, Sam!"

‚úÖ 3. Debug the Bug
‚úîÔ∏è You correctly spotted the issue ‚Äî missing closing parenthesis.

‚úÖ Correct version:

```js
Copy
Edit
sayHello("Asha");
```

‚úÖ 4. Concept Check: Return vs Log
| Statement                                                      | Your Answer | Correct? | Explanation                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `return` sends a value out of the function so it can be reused | ‚ùå FALSE     | ‚úÖ TRUE   | Return **does** send the value back                        |
| `console.log()` is the best way to pass data between functions | ‚ùå FALSE     | ‚úÖ TRUE   | Correct ‚Äì it's for **display**, not passing data           |
| You can have a function with no `return` at all                | ‚úÖ TRUE      | ‚úÖ TRUE   | Correct! Not all functions return values                   |
| A `return` will stop the function immediately                  | ‚ùå FALSE     | ‚úÖ TRUE   | `return` ends the function ‚Äì anything after it doesn‚Äôt run |

üß† So 3/4 were marked as false when two of them should‚Äôve been true ‚Äî but your instincts were close!

‚úÖ 5. Write Your Own
Write a function called addThree that takes a number and returns that number plus 3.

Call it with the number 5 and store the result in a variable called result. Then log result.

```js
// write function called addThree that takes a number
function addThree(number) {
    // take number and return number + 3
    return number + 3;
}
// call with number 5 and store in a variable called result
let result = addThree(5);
//log result
console.log(result);
```
‚úÖ Perfect execution! That‚Äôs exactly right ‚Äî clear, complete, and correct.
| Step                        | What‚Äôs Happening                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `function addThree(number)` | Declares a function with a `number` parameter |
| `return number + 3;`        | Calculates and **returns** the result         |
| `addThree(5)`               | Calls the function with `5` (an **argument**) |
| `let result = ...`          | Stores the returned value (8) in a variable   |
| `console.log(result);`      | Prints `8` to the console                     |

‚úÖ 1. Quick Fill-in-the-Blank (Retrieval)
Say or write your answers before checking!

A function expression is when a function is **stored/ assigned** to a variable.
The function in an expression is often **anonymous** (has no name).
The **return** keyword is used to return a value from a function.
The console.log() method is used to **log/ send** a value to the screen.

‚úÖ 2. Code Reading Challenge
What will this log to the console?
```js

const greet = function(name) {
  return `Hi, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet("Zara"));
```

Answer: "Hi, Zara!"

‚úÖ 3. Debug the Bug
What‚Äôs wrong with this code?
```js
const addNumbers = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

let result = addnumbers(3, 4);
console.log(Result);
```
Answer: case issues of R and r in 'result' variable name
  same with
  addnumbers ‚û§ should be addNumbers (case-sensitive)

‚úÖ 4. True or False? Function Concepts
Function expressions are hoisted like function declarations.
FALSE

An anonymous function has no name.
TRUE -  the name is the variable name that the function is stored in

You can pass a function expression into another function.
TRUE- refer to the variable name?
Functions are values ‚Äî so yes! You pass them using their variable name

The return statement must always be used in a function.
FALSE - Only needed if you want to send back a value

‚úÖ 5. Write Your Own
Write a function expression called tripleIt that:
- Takes one number
- Returns the number multiplied by 3
- Call it with 7 and store the result in a variable called output
- Log output to the console
```js
//Write a function expression called tripleIt that:
//- Takes one number
const tripleIt = function(number) {
//- Returns the number multiplied by 3
  return number * 3;
}
// Call it with 7 and store the result in a variable called output
let output = triplet(7);
//- Log output to the console
console.log(output);  // should return 21
```

‚úÖ 1. Quick Fire: Fill in the Blanks
Say or write your answers before checking!

A function expression is a function stored in a **variable**.
In a function expression, the function is often **annonymous** (has no name).
You call a function expression using the **variable** name.
The return statement sends a **value** back to where the function was called.

‚úÖ 2. Code Reading
What will this log to the console?
```js
const describeAnimal = function(type, name) {
  return `This is my ${type}, ${name}.`;
};

let message = describeAnimal("rabbit", "Pretzel");
console.log(message); // "This is my rabbit, Pretzel."
```

‚úÖ 3. Debug the Bug
There‚Äôs something wrong here. What needs fixing?
```js

const double = function(num) {
  return num * 2;
};

let result = Double(4);
console.log(Result);
```
Thare are casing issues with the variable names double/ Double and result/ Result

‚úÖ 4. True or False?
Function expressions must have a name.
   FALSE- there are ofter annonymous

A function can return a string, number, or even another function.
  TRUE

A function will always run as soon as it's defined.
  FALSE - it must be called();

You can call a function expression before it's defined in the code.
  FALSE- How will it know?

  ‚úÖ 5. Code Task
Write a function expression called greetUser that:
- Takes a name
- Returns a message like Hello, NAME!
- Call it with your name and log the result
```js
// Write a function expression called greetUser that:
//- Takes a name
const greetUser = function(name) {
  //- Returns a message like Hello, NAME!
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
//- Call it with your name and log the result
let greeting = greetUser("Roman");
console.log(greeting);
```
