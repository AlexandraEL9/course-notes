## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

### Requirements
- Gather and document user and stakeholder needs.
- Create requirement specifications.

### Design
- Design system architecture and interfaces.
- Create technical and design documents.

### Development
- Build system components and modules.
- Write and test code (unit testing).

### Testing
- Perform integration, system, and acceptance testing.
- Identify and fix defects.

### Integration
- Combine components and test them together.

### Deployment
- Install and configure in a live environment.
- Train users and provide support.

## Agile Methodology

### Agile Manifesto
Values from the Agile Manifesto:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

### What is Agile Methodology?
- A flexible and iterative approach to software development.
- Built on values rather than strict rules.
- Includes frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, XP.

### Waterfall vs Agile
**Waterfall:**
- Linear, phase-by-phase.
- Good for projects with strict requirements.

**Agile:**
- Iterative and adaptable.
- Ideal for evolving requirements or fast feedback cycles.

## Scrum Framework

### Scrum Ceremonies
- **Daily Stand-up**: Sync and remove blockers (15 mins).
- **Sprint Planning**: Plan work for the sprint.
- **Sprint Review**: Demo completed work to stakeholders.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect and improve team process.
- **Backlog Refinement**: Review and prioritise upcoming tasks.

### Scrum Roles
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the process, removes blockers.
- **Product Owner**: Owns the backlog and business priorities.
- **Developers**: Build and deliver the product.
- **Stakeholders**: End-users or decision makers.

### Scrum Artefacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritised list of work/features.
- **Sprint Backlog**: Tasks committed for the current sprint.

### Other Agile Frameworks
- **Kanban**, **Extreme Programming (XP)**, and hybrid models like **Scrumban**.

## Project Management in Jira

### What is Jira?
A popular tool for managing Agile projects and tracking work items.

### Jira Backlog & Boards
- Create a **product backlog** and sprint backlog.
- Use boards to visualise work (To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Done).

### Jira Hierarchy
- **Epics**: Large features.
- **User Stories**: Small, user-focused tasks.
- **Tasks**: Non-user specific work (e.g. setup, docs).
- **Subtasks**: Breakdown of stories.
- **Bugs**: Issues that impair functionality.

### Other Jira Features
- Jira includes dashboards, reports, and integration features that support Agile workflows.

---

## Pair Programming

### What is Pair Programming?
- Two developers share one workstation.
- One is the **driver** (types), one is the **navigator** (reviews, guides).

### Why Pair Programming?
- Fewer mistakes ("two pairs of eyes").
- Knowledge sharing.
- Team collaboration and resilience.

### Mob Programming
- Whole team works together on one problem, on one screen.
- Maximises collaboration and understanding of the codebase.
